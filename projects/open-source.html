A list of open source projects I've either co-created or maintained.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">OpenStack ~ cloud computing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
It all started when <a href="https://twitter.com/jmckenty">Joshua McKenty</a> called me and asks if I want to
help on open data projects at NASA.
</p>

<p>
We spent over a year trying to cobble together existing open source
tools to enable scientists/researchers/engineers/developers.  We
wanted to enable them to do their awesome science without focusing on
all the drudgery of running a continous integration service, online
code repostiories, application servers, online datasets, etc.
</p>

<p>
After some very painful attempts at using existing software, we
grabbed some <a href="http://www.papalote-sf.com/">burritos</a> and started developing what would become the
compute part of OpenStack.
</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/termie">Andy Smith (termie)</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vish">Vish Ishaya Abrams</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jmckenty">Joshua McKenty</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/xtoddx">Todd Willey</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/devcamcar">Devin Carlen</a> and myself worked to build something we could work for
our needs at NASA. <a href="https://twitter.com/soosiechoi">Soo Choi</a> kept our company and the project moving
forward at NASA, including mountains of paperwork and process needed
to do "agile" the NASA way.
</p>

<p>
We switched over to running VMs for <a href="https://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and a collection of NASA
projects. Eventually we combined forces with <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>'s object
storage project to create the initial release of OpenStack.

<h2 id="sec-2">UserScripts.org ~ powerups for your browser</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<a href="http://www.aaronboodman.com/">Aaron Boodman</a> created Greasemonkey in 2005.  I fell in love.  All of a
sudden any user could inject code into any webpage they visited.
Making the web yours!
</p>

<p>
Mashups.  User Customization.  Powerups.
</p>

<p>
I created this site with <a href="https://twitter.com/bs">Britt Selvitelle</a> to help share and find scripts.
</p>

<p>
It was based on Ruby on Rails.  At its peak it had tens of thousands
of scripts, millions of monthly visitors, and an extremely active api.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="open-source/userscripts-org.png" alt="userscripts-org.png">
</p>
</div>

<p>
I really miss this project.  I loved working on it.  I loved how much
power it gave to users.  I loved working on all aspects of a website
from sys-admin to front-end design.  There was a high in going from a
forum discussion to improving code to deploying a site serving
hundreds of requests per second on a single server to .
</p>

<p>
I had to shut it down due to the combination of life events, legal
threats and increasing sophistication from "baddies" trying to abuse
users (scripts running in the browser context could steal cookies or
worse.)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Book Burro</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Book Burro started as a Greasemonkey extension to help me find books
in gradschool.  It evolved to extensions for Firefox and Chrome.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Book Burro was a Web 2.0 extension for Firefox. When it sensed you
were looking at a page that contains a book, it overlayed a small
panel which when opened lists prices at online bookstores such as
Amazon, Buy, Half (and many more) and whether the book is available at
your library.
</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="open-source/book-burro.png" alt="book-burro.png">
</p>
</div>

<p>
It leveraged APIs when possible, but resorted to scraping book stores
and libraries.  Additionally users could add scraping rules to check
their library and share it with the rest of the community.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Colour Spot</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
This was a simple Mac OS X application which resided in the menu bar
and acted like a color dropper for the entire os.
</p>

<p>
Motivation: a quicker way to grab a color - hold a modifer (shift) and
see the hex rgb color in the statusbar.  Clicking the color in the
statusmenu copies it to the clipboard.

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">More Interestingness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/jakedahn">Jake Dahn, child of the internet</a> and I created an extension for Chrome
which would use the Flickr api to grab the "interestingness" feed, and
pre-cache (what flickr thinks is) great picture you could see every
time you opened a new tab in Chrome.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Wii Me</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
When the Nintendo Wii were released, they were extremely hard to get.
Even months later, sellers including Amazon would run of of stock
almost as soon as they got them in.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="open-source/wiime.jpg" alt="wiime.jpg">
</p>
</div>

<p>
A few lines of ruby code, querying the amazon e-commerce API
(determining if the Wii was in stock), if so, tweeting it out
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203212822/https://twitter.com/WiiMe">twitter.com/WiiMe ~ archive.org</a>&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I got a Wii.  I also helped a few hundred other people get theirs. I
was happy to see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080516135020/https://evhead.com/2007/12/i-love-this-twitter-wiime-i-check.asp">Ev Williams</a> share his love of it :)

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">s3://</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
This is an extension that made Amazon S3 links work in Mozilla Firefox.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="open-source/s3.png" alt="s3.png">
</p>
</div>


<p>
You could drag-and-drop to upload.  Bookmark.  And the url bar would
have the s3://bucket/key name in it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8">Taboo ~ the cure for tabitis</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
Taboo was an extension for Firefox that utilied the "save session" code to put tabs to sleep.
</p>

<p>
When the user clicked "save", it would take a screenshot, save the tab
state (similar to how scroll position, etc is saved when you restart
your browser), and save the text content of the page.
</p>

<p>
Then you could search through the saved tabs (including full-text search)
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="open-source/taboo.png" alt="taboo.png">
</p>
</div>

<p>
Taboo was created when extensions were given full priviledges in
browsers.  I was able to reach into lots of internals to add this
functionality.  Sandboxing of extensions and a real API limit these
sort of ideas from being implemented now-a-days.

<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9">Tux Typing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Because my focus in college/grad school was topics other than
programming, I started contributing to open source.  Eventually I
found a typing game I started contributing to:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="open-source/tux-typing.jpg" alt="tux-typing.jpg">

Eventually I was promoted to project lead.  I learned a lot about game
programming.  SDL.  Building and shipping on multiple platforms.
